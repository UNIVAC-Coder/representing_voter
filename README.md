# representing_voter
## Elected officials will transparently represent their constituents.

The creation of an open transparent voter register will allow the elected person to truly represent their constituents.  All that is needed is a cloud based anonymus register which can be queried by the public to show how people in an area choose to be represented by their elector's vote.

I'm looking at using Python as the code base.
